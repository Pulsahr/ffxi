# Gearswap files for FFXI

I wrote some files to simplify complicated macros.

First request was the solo skillchain for SCH. Then something about casting buff but don't wait if instant cast.
I thought I might share this in a wider way.

I try to stay away from any form of botting. It's not the fear of any sanction (I honestly don't care that much), it's my ethic.
If you think my script is close to botting, feel free to write me and tell me why, I'll gladly remove any guilty script.
